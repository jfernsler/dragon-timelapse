# raspi_timelapse
Dynamic timelapse using the raspi camera, ffmpeg to assemble and sftp to perform an upload.

####Requires the following:
* timelapse.py
* uploadCleanup.py
* ffmepgCmd
* capture.php

capture.php is currently pretty poor. It does the job but needs a serious visual overhaul.

#####capture.php wishlist
* use flat file for user names
* add more data to the timelapse status file
* look more awesomer
